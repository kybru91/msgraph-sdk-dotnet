# Contributing to the Microsoft Graph .Net Client Library
Thanks for considering making a contribution! Read over our guidelines and we will do our best to see your PRs merged successfully.

**NOTE**: A signed a contribution license agreement is required for all contributions and is checked automatically on new pull requests. You will be asked to read and sign the agreement https://cla.microsoft.com/ after submitting a request to this repository.

There are a few different recommended paths to get contributions into the released version of this library.

## File issues
The best way to get started with a contribution is to start a dialog with us. Sometimes features will be under development or out of scope for this library, and it's best to check before starting work on contribution, especially for large work items.

## Pull requests
All pull requests should be submitted against the **main** branch or a specific feature branch. The main branch is intended to represent the code released in the most-recent Nuget package.

## Commit message format

To support our automated release process, pull requests are required to follow the [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
format.

Each commit message consists of a **header**, an optional **body** and an optional **footer**. The header is the first line of the commit and
MUST have a **type** (see below for a list of types) and a **description**. An optional **scope** can be added to the header to give extra context.

```
<type>[optional scope]: <short description>
<BLANK LINE>
<optional body>
<BLANK LINE>
<optional footer(s)>
```

The recommended commit types used are:

 - **feat** for feature updates (increments the _minor_ version)
 - **fix** for bug fixes (increments the _patch_ version)
 - **perf** for performance related changes e.g. optimizing an algorithm
 - **refactor** for code refactoring changes
 - **test** for test suite updates e.g. adding a test or fixing a test
 - **style** for changes that don't affect the meaning of code. e.g. formatting changes
 - **docs** for documentation updates e.g. ReadMe update or code documentation updates
 - **build** for build system changes (gradle updates, external dependency updates)
 - **ci** for CI configuration file changes e.g. updating a pipeline
 - **chore** for miscallaneous non-sdk changesin the repo e.g. removing an unused file

Adding a footer with the prefix **BREAKING CHANGE:** will cause an increment of the _major_ version.

When a new package is about to be release, the release PR will be merged into main. The package will be generated from main.

Some things to note about this project:

### How the library is built
The .Net client library has a handwritten set of core files and folders for generated models and request builders. These models and request builders are generated using [Kiota](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota). **Changes made to the ```Generated``` folder will be overwritten** the next time the generator is run. 

### How the generator works
You can view the [README](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota/blob/main/README.md) for a full run-through of its capabilities.

For the purposes of the .Net client library, the generator runs through an openApi file generated from the CSDL document file published by Microsoft Graph (https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata) and builds up an in-memory list of models.

### When new features are added to the library
Generation happens as part of a manual process that occurs once a significant change or set of changes has been added to the Graph. This may include:
 - A new workload comes to v1.0 of Graph (Microsoft Teams, Batching, etc.)
 - There is significant addition of functionality (Delta Queries, etc.)
 
However, this is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. If the library is missing v1.0 Graph functionality that you wish to utilize, please [file an issue](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-dotnet/issues).

We do our best to prevent breaking changes from being introduced into the library during this process. If you find a breaking change, please file an issue and we will work to get this resolved ASAP.
